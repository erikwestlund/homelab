- [ ] Customize dashboards for specific needs

## Short-Term Goals (Next 2 Weeks)

### 4. Configure Alerts & Notifications
- [ ] Deploy ntfy push notification service
  - [ ] Set up ntfy server container on docker-services-host
  - [ ] Configure authentication and topics
  - [ ] Install ntfy mobile apps
  - [ ] Test push notifications
- [ ] Set up Grafana alerts for:
  - [ ] UPS battery low (<20%)
  - [ ] UPS on battery power
  - [ ] Docker container failures

  - [ ] Disk space warnings (<10% free)
- [ ] Configure notification channels:
  - [ ] ntfy (primary push notifications)
  - [ ] Email (backup)
  - [ ] Discord webhook (optional)

### 5. Optimize Data Collection
- [ ] Fine-tune Telegraf collection intervals
- [ ] Set up downsampling tasks in InfluxDB
- [ ] Configure selective Home Assistant entity filtering
- [ ] Test and verify storage growth rates

### 6. Create Custom Dashboards
- [ ] Homelab overview dashboard showing:
  - [ ] All UPS status at a glance
  - [ ] Critical service health
  - [ ] Network connectivity status
  - [ ] Storage usage trends
- [ ] Energy cost calculator dashboard
- [ ] Service uptime/availability dashboard

## Medium-Term Goals (1-2 Months)

### 7. Expand Monitoring Coverage
- [ ] Add Proxmox host monitoring (CPU, RAM, VM stats)
- [ ] Monitor network equipment (switches, APs)
- [ ] Add internet connection quality monitoring
- [ ] Integrate smart home device metrics
- [ ] Monitor backup job success/failure

### 8. Advanced Analytics
- [ ] Implement anomaly detection for power usage
- [ ] Create predictive UPS runtime models
- [ ] Set up capacity planning dashboards
- [ ] Build cost analysis for power consumption

### 9. Automation Integration
- [ ] Create HA automations based on metrics:
  - [ ] Auto-shutdown non-critical services on UPS battery
  - [ ] Temperature-based cooling control
  - [ ] Load balancing based on resource usage
- [ ] Implement auto-remediation for common issues

## Long-Term Goals (3-6 Months)

### 10. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement multi-tier storage (hot/warm/cold)
- [ ] Set up automated backup rotation
- [ ] Create aggregated yearly summary tables
- [ ] Optimize query performance for historical data

### 11. Disaster Recovery
- [ ] Set up offsite backup replication
- [ ] Create automated recovery procedures
- [ ] Document restoration processes
- [ ] Test full system recovery

### 12. Advanced Visualizations
- [ ] Create mobile-friendly dashboards
- [ ] Build public status page (read-only)
- [ ] Implement custom Grafana plugins
- [ ] Create executive summary reports

## Future Considerations

### 13. Machine Learning
- [ ] Implement predictive maintenance alerts
- [ ] Energy usage pattern recognition
- [ ] Anomaly detection for security monitoring
- [ ] Automated capacity planning recommendations

### 14. Integration Expansion
- [ ] Add Prometheus for Kubernetes monitoring
- [ ] Integrate with cloud services monitoring
- [ ] Add application performance monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Include log aggregation (Loki)

### 15. Security Monitoring
- [ ] Add fail2ban metrics
- [ ] Monitor authentication attempts
- [ ] Track network traffic patterns
- [ ] Implement intrusion detection alerts

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Reviews (Monthly)
- [ ] Review and optimize dashboard performance
- [ ] Check storage growth vs. projections
- [ ] Update Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Review and tune alerts
- [ ] Verify backup integrity

### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Update all container images
- [ ] Review retention policies
- [ ] Audit data collection efficiency
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Documentation Needs
- [ ] Create runbook for common issues
- [ ] Document all custom queries
- [ ] Build troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams
- [ ] Write backup/restore procedures

## Notes
- Priority should be on getting basic monitoring operational first
- Focus on actionable metrics that drive decisions
- Ensure monitoring doesn't impact system performance
- Keep security in mind - don't expose sensitive metrics
- Plan for growth - the homelab will expand!
