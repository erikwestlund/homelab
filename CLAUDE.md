# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains infrastructure-as-code for managing homelab services across Proxmox servers. Services can be deployed to any server based on resource requirements and availability.

The repository provides scripts, Docker configurations, Ansible playbooks, and deployment templates for quick service configuration.

## Zigbee-MQTT Commands

### Initial Setup
```bash
# From services/zigbee-mqtt directory
./setup.sh                          # Install to default /opt/docker
./setup.sh --install-dir ~/homelab  # Install to custom directory
```

### Docker Operations
```bash
# From the installation directory (e.g., /opt/docker)
docker-compose up -d          # Start all services
docker-compose down           # Stop all services
docker-compose logs -f        # View logs for all services
docker-compose logs mosquitto # View specific service logs
docker-compose restart zigbee2mqtt # Restart specific service
docker-compose pull          # Update Docker images
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Install monitoring script (creates cron job)
sudo ./install-monitor.sh

# Manual health check
docker-compose ps  # Check container status
curl http://localhost:8080  # Test Zigbee2MQTT web UI
```

## Deployment Workflow

1. **Development**: Work in service directories (`services/*/`)
2. **Testing**: Test configurations locally or in development environment
3. **Production**: Deploy using Ansible playbooks or copy final configs to `deployments/`
4. **Backup**: Store sensitive data and backups in `backups/` (gitignored)

## Zigbee-MQTT Architecture

### Service Structure
- **Mosquitto**: MQTT broker on ports 1883 (MQTT) and 9001 (WebSocket)
- **Zigbee2MQTT**: Zigbee gateway with web UI on port 8080, connects to Mosquitto for MQTT communication

### Installation Directory Layout
```
/opt/docker/ (or custom installation directory)
├── .env                          # Environment variables (generated by setup.sh)
├── docker-compose.yml            # Main compose file (generated from template)
├── mosquitto/
│   ├── config/
│   │   ├── mosquitto.conf       # MQTT broker configuration
│   │   └── passwd               # MQTT user credentials (hashed)
│   ├── data/                    # Persistent MQTT data
│   └── log/                     # MQTT logs
└── zigbee2mqtt/
    └── data/
        ├── configuration.yaml    # Zigbee2MQTT configuration
        ├── state.json           # Device states
        └── database.db          # Device database
```

### Key Scripts (in services/zigbee-mqtt/)
- **setup.sh**: Initializes environment, generates configs, creates MQTT users
- **install-monitor.sh**: Sets up cron-based monitoring for service health
- **monitor-zigbee.sh**: Health check script that restarts services if needed

### Configuration Flow
1. `setup.sh` reads `docker/.env.example` and `docker/docker-compose.yml.template`
2. Generates random MQTT credentials and creates `.env` file
3. Creates Mosquitto configuration with authentication
4. Generates Zigbee2MQTT config with MQTT connection details
5. Produces final `docker-compose.yml` with proper device mappings

### Important Configuration Files
- `.env`: Contains ZIGBEE_SERIAL_PORT, MQTT_USER, MQTT_PASS, TZ
- `mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf`: MQTT broker settings, authentication config
- `zigbee2mqtt/data/configuration.yaml`: Device settings, MQTT connection, web UI config

## Development Notes

### General Repository Guidelines
- Each service has its own directory under `services/`
- Use Ansible roles in `ansible/roles/` for automated deployment
- Production-ready configurations go in `deployments/`
- Use `backups/` for sensitive data that shouldn't be in git
- Keep deployment files named with their standard names (e.g., `docker-compose.yml`)

### Zigbee-MQTT Specific Notes
- Environment variables in `.env` are used by both docker-compose.yml and passed to containers
- The `ZIGBEE_SERIAL_PORT` can be USB (`/dev/ttyUSB0`) or network (`tcp://host:port`)
- All generated files should be excluded from git (check .gitignore)
- Services depend on each other: Zigbee2MQTT requires Mosquitto to be healthy first

### Adding New Services
1. Create directory under `services/`
2. Create Ansible role in `ansible/roles/`
3. Add setup scripts and documentation
4. Test thoroughly
5. Deploy with Ansible playbooks

## UPS Monitoring (NUT + PeaNUT)

### Overview
Network UPS Tools (NUT) server running on dedicated VM (ups-monitor.lan) with PeaNUT web interface for monitoring two CyberPower UPS units.

### UPS Configuration
- **homelab**: Powers servers and homelab equipment (Serial: CXXPU7012005)
- **network**: Powers network equipment (Serial: CXXNU7009695)

### Access
- PeaNUT Web UI: http://ups-monitor.lan:8086
- NUT Server: ups-monitor.lan:3493

### Ansible Deployment
```bash
# Deploy UPS monitoring server
ansible-playbook -i inventories/homelab.yml playbooks/ups-monitor.yml

# The playbook will:
# - Install NUT server and configure both UPS devices
# - Set up PeaNUT web interface
# - Configure proper USB passthrough permissions
```

### Manual UPS Commands
```bash
# List UPS devices
upsc -l

# Check UPS status
upsc homelab@localhost
upsc network@localhost

# Test from remote host
upsc homelab@ups-monitor.lan:3493
```

## Monitoring Stack (InfluxDB + Telegraf + Grafana)

### Overview
Comprehensive monitoring solution collecting metrics from Docker, system resources, UPS devices, and Home Assistant. Configured for long-term storage (5+ years) with downsampling.

### Components
- **InfluxDB 2.7**: Time-series database with 5-year retention
- **Telegraf 1.31**: Metrics collector configured for:
  - Docker container stats
  - System metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
  - NUT/UPS monitoring
  - Home Assistant data via webhook
- **Grafana 11.1.0**: Visualization with pre-configured dashboards

### Deployment
```bash
# Using setup script
cd /opt/docker/monitoring-stack
./setup.sh
docker-compose up -d

# Using Ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventories/homelab.yml playbooks/deploy-monitoring-stack.yml
```

### Access
- Grafana: http://docker-services-host.lan:3000
- InfluxDB: http://docker-services-host.lan:8086
- Telegraf HTTP listener: http://docker-services-host.lan:8087

### Home Assistant Integration
Add to HA configuration.yaml:
```yaml
influxdb:
  api_version: 2
  ssl: false
  host: docker-services-host.lan
  port: 8086
  token: "YOUR_TOKEN_FROM_ENV"  # Get from monitoring-stack/.env
  organization: homelab
  bucket: metrics
```

### Long-Term Storage
